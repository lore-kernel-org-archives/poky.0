There won't be any problems with dlopen() because that only looks at
.so files.  Any issues will be at build time, I wouldn't be surprised
if some dependencies changed due to a difference in eg pkgconfig vs
.la linkage.  Then again some other distros blanket-delete .la files
by default so I don't expect any critical problems.

I don't think a distro feature is the right approach, but however it's
set can easily be forced using a machine override for Darwin.
