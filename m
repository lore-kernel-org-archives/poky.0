Checksums and timestamps are not enough to determine a logical progression of
the components.

We need something that informs the user where these changes fit in the grand
scheme of things.  Are they newer or older then a recipe of the same name (and
package version)?

So this really allows us to visualize multiple levels of upstream work:

Level 1 - Upstream "version"  (PV)

Level 2 - Upstream (oe-core) recipe versioning (PR)

...

Level N - Local build and configuration versioning (checksum based & auto
incrementing)


In a lot of projects 1, 2 and N are enough.. but it's understandable to add in
other intermediate levels to indicate different upstreams along the way.  (Such
as if a company has their own internal distribution..)

I've seen cases where a level 3 exists to indicate a "distribution version"..

Level N (when done manually) has usually captured major system configuration
changes and rebuilding in order to enable solver tools to upgrade properly.


While the checksum will be able to point a unique instance of the recipe to a
given PR... it doesn't guaranty any type of logical numbering.. other then a new
checksum is a new (presumably larger) PR number.  By adding in the various
levels of version information the checksum becomes "more" unique as it only
refers to specific 'upstream' revisions, and make it more logical that a level
1, 2, ... N change means it's a "newer" version of the package.
