Ok, I have a patch queue'ed up already with this fix, I will push it as
part of a consolidated request later tonight.

I agree, I am not sure why this is happening also, I thought that I did
installs of 0.11 and did not see the ust directory, maybe I did not
force or something.  Maybe diff the marker.h files and see if there are
differences?

Sau!
