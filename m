I would suggest the most important one as mostly those headers would be 
the same. Picking something like a common header file or the file that 
contains main() would make sense.

At this point I think the work you are doing is valuable but better 
suited to live in a layer.  The core is really targeted to be as generic 
as possible to allow for a broad variety of devices.

Richard recently suggested that a repo be created for such meta layers. 
We are working out the details on creating and opening up that repo.
