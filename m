The needs for the arm case include both executables and libraries.  The pro=
cessor feature can be used, but that only covers the libraries themselves. =
 We want a mechanism to say that the whole system is built thumb2, except f=
or a particular compilation modules, library and/or application.  (generall=
y is done on a full recipe basis, and not on a single compilation module..)

The other issue on ARM embedded systems is that the processor feature appro=
ach typically makes the system larger, by providing both the lesser optimiz=
ed and more completely optimized libraries....  I've had resistence to this=
 approach from customer over that reason.  (mind you I'm in favor of making=
 that easier to use in OE as well.)
