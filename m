It does indeed.

Valid point. A name change has been proposed for a similar reason.

Not at all, it's the only one that's supported right now whilst the
feature it's based on is undergoing change. It's definitely on the
agenda to make this underlying functionality (INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE - or
whatever it becomes) be better exposed through the GUI.

This is a well considered suggestion, thanks. Unfortunately I'm not sure
how we'd implement this within the current code base (at least, not
without some significant churn) so I'm adding it to the "ideas for
later" pile.

Consider it considered ;-)
