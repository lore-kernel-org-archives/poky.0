This raises some questions about how the pull model works as I'd been
holding off the python RDEPENDS change until I'd had time to check
something out yet you've applied it. I haven't had the time to be able
to make any informed feedback on the patch yet whether it was ok or not
and being able to give any informed feedback takes time.

My basic concern that that the RDEPENDS shouldn't be having that effect
on native packages and it if it, we probably have a bug somewhere else
that likely needs fixing.

So the question is whether we are going truly for the pull model, who
are the people top of tree, what code review applies to patches from
those people, how absence might get handled and so forth.

As an illustration, it would have been much more useful for me if
someone had pulled the individual patches together into a single git
branch and presented that. This helps me as it highlights the
outstanding patches and is what Saul does with many of the Yocto
patches.

I'm aware there are a few patches pending review and I'm thinking the
best approach may be some kind of staging/-next type branch where we
keep these as we review and then either accept, reject or ask for
improvements.

One other thing I noticed is that Khem merged a patch known to be broken
and then a fixup for it several commits later. I don't like to do that
for known breakage since it means things are not bisectable and in that
case I'd have squashed the changes with an update to the commit message
about the change. Its not a major issue but something to keep in mind
going forwards.

Cheers,

Richard
