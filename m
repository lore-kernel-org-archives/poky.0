Not a dumb question at all! Unfortunately, I think a lot of people are
confused about this, which is natural as much of this separation is
still new to people.

There is: http://www.yoctoproject.org/community/mailing-lists

Which needs to be updated to better reflect the oe-core aspect I think.

And: http://openembedded.org/index.php/Mailing_lists

This accurately describes oe-core (and other oe specific lists).

No. As I understand it, things that go into poky.git/meta and things
that go into oe-core should be sent to the openembedded-core list. Patch
series for poky.git should be isolated in such a way so that they do not
include changes to meta (oe-core) and other areas at the same time.

Does anyone have a different view?
