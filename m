The main point is to ensure the runtime is GPLv3 free. With those files
removed, that is the case. If you share a mirror with some GPLv3 code in
it, it has a very different effect licensing wise compared to v3
binaries on a system. I'm not a lawyer though and I'd be interested to
know if you've heard a different interpretation of the license?

As Nitin replied, I thought that was removed already?
