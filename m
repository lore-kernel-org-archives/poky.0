This is a very popular use-case in carrier grade systems.  Back haul voice,=
 data, etc applications that require large routing databases or billing dat=
abases.  The other use I've seen for multilibs is some very specialized DVR=
 systems where large amount of video need to stay in memory for quick retri=
eval.

What I've seen in the past is the ability to build multilibs has improved t=
he quality of the software integration by finding poorly constructed header=
s, hard coded library paths, etc... All things we should fix.
