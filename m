This is a tangent, but a couple of points:

1) This rename would not come for free. We'd need to update people's existing 
bblayers.conf files on the fly, as we did when meta-yocto-bsp was split out of 
meta-yocto, and thus bump LCONF_VERSION; however, doing this only in poky has 
resulted in annoying problems when users remove poky from their configurations 
(since LCONF_VERSION is out-of-step between Poky and OE-Core, leading to 
confusing errors in this situation). Thus I think we'd want to solve this once 
and for all by bumping the value in OE-Core as well as Poky.

2) If you propose this rename, perhaps you will also consider renaming 
meta-oe, since that name within a similarly named meta-openembedded repository 
leads to a similar level of confusion...?

Cheers,
Paul
