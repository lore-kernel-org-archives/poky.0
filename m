This all depends on the scope of these tools. If the scope is only the Yocto 
Project QA team, adding them to the core would be a difficult sell. However, if 
the target audience were a larger number of BSP maintainers (and to be honest, 
I would expect maintainers of BSPs for hardware supporting GL acceleration to 
want to be able to run these tests) then adding these components to the core 
starts to make sense, to me at least.

There is a "third" way - use combo-layer to keep a maintained copy of the 
recipe in the "meta-yocto-qa" layer, just as we do with OE-Core within the 
poky repository. It has worked well enough there, although here we would be 
being more selective about the recipes we were pulling; it could be 
problematic if for example a dependency were added from a recipe that is part 
of the filter on a recipe that is not part of the filter.

This is a tricky thing. If we start relying heavily on layers for our builds 
that we don't currently have an active role in maintaining, there will be a 
natural assumption that we'll step up and help maintain those layers; it will 
be made more difficult if those layers contain a large number of recipes.

Specifically regarding meta-oe, as you may be aware our reluctance to use this 
layer directly up to now was because of its use of bbappends and overlayed 
recipes that change the apparent behaviour of core recipes. Most of this has 
been tidied up, however one last such issue still exists [1] and is apparently 
still leading to problems for users [2], so there is still work needing to be 
done here.
