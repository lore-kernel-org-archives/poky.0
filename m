I've been thinking this would be the other way around. The act of adding
some conf/machine/include/* files would then trigger the inheritance of
the multilib class with the parameter specified at the point of the
inclusion.

Its use case specific and I agree the above is hacky. It would be better
to have that option with known caveats that none at all though.

Yes, we've going to have to watch for this kind of issue and get it
fixed as and where we find it.

Great, thanks for the feedback!
