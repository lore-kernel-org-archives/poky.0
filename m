I grep'd all the XML files in the documentation directory and got three hit=
s:

 * 'meta/recipes-sata/tasks/task-poky.bb' appears in the Poky Reference man=
ual
 * '$ bitbake -c clean task-boot task-base task-poky' appears in the Poky R=
eference manual
 * 'local.conf.sample' appears in the Poky Reference manual.

Should these be the following:

 * meta/recipes-sata/tasks/task-core.bb
 * $ bitbake -c clean task-boot task-base task-core

Not sure what to do with the occurrence of 'local.conf.sample'.  Just remov=
e it?

Richard,

Thanks for taking the time to do this. I did a quick check and meta-oe, met=
a-efl, meta-angstrom, meta-texasinstruments and meta-shr seem to be up to d=
ate with those changes now.

regards,

Koen
