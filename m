Well, you've seen Koen's reaction to the prospect of multilib support,
there is one example. I've given x32 as another at the start of this
thread. Its an issue I keep hearing about from companies too.

Fundamentally, multilib is one of the biggest remaining weaknesses of
the OE architecture. One of Yoctos objectives is to reduce the number of
build systems out there and to do this, we need to make one good fully
featured one. Until OE has multilib support there is a functionality
gap. I don't see any technical reason OE can't support mulitlibs and I
don't believe the complexity is high either, we just need to tweak some
things. 

I actually believe the core in OE is well suited to multilib support and
using it will show off some of the power in the OE architecture as I
think we can do it better than anyone else before!

The multilib conf files are responsible for changing BBCLASSEXTEND, I
don't want to see the need for many, if any recipe specific changes.

The recipe specific problems are likely to be limited to the likes of
hardcoded library paths and those already break things like
DISTRO="minimal" in OE.dev today.
