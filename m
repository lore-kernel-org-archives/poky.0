This might be at least one source of the cross posting as people are not 
sure poky vs oe-core.

This seems logical to me. Thanks.  I also think discussion of a 
potential patch should be done on the list that the patch would go to yes?

Maybe we could drive that definition to ground and get the mailing list

So above, perhaps my "whole bunch" was overstated.  Let me retract that 
and say at least some.

I don't mean to pick on you Darren; I really am just trying to 
understand and an example is often helpful.  Earlier you and Richard 
were discussing directdisc images [1] with a suggestion that it might be 
ripe for removal.  Should that have been on oe-core?
