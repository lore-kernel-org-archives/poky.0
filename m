I know this time would come!

So this is up for discussion in a big way!

There was some initial discussion at ELC this last week about what goes 
where and how layers are going to work moving forward.  I know that we 
are committed to the qemu* machines in oe-core (meta), and that 
currently meta-yocto contains a set of core HW (beagleboard among them), 
so the question then is should the HW specific stuff, such as this patch 
move to meta-yocto or some other layer?  There are a couple other 
recipes such as x-load and formfactor that contain HW specific files.

I believe and others will have to confirm this, that some distros may 
want to use these core files, but not via meta-yocto as a layer, or do 
those distros have these files modified differently (ie, not just 
copies, which would be bad).

This is all food for thought.

Sau!
