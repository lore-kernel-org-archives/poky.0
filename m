I could be more verbose, but it's like reading a kernel -mm commit. I
don't grok everything they write, but they aren't writing it for me as a
-mm newbie.

do_validate_branches() has to check if the HEAD of meta matches the meta
SRCREV that the BSP defines. If they don't match, it saves the old branch
as $branch-orig. So you have two branches, with the base meta commit
(which is what is tested).  I don't want to destroy any branches, since the=
re
is value in keeping them around.

The tools are actually separate to the bitbake bindings, so they don't expe=
ct
this to happen. I could destroy the old branch in do_validate_branches, but
that's not a solution I particularly liked. It was easier to add some
flexibility to
the tools.

Cheers,
