There is some thinking going on at the moment about merging genericx86
and qemux86 since the two machines are converging and any differences
could be dealt with at runtime. To me, this is a key detail.

I agree that -mga is a push for OE-Core but the other drivers are useful
and I can see a case for moving them towards the core rather than having
several layers needing them.

Cheers,
