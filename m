As another follow up. The thread can be summarized as "It doesn't
look like it should have worked before, and qemu's pat emulation
may be the issue'.

The suggestion is to run with 'nopat', which is what Richard originally
did.

So I'm going to prep a patch that drops the kernel patch, and leaves
nopat enabled on the qemu command line. That should get us put back
together in a semi-permanent way.
