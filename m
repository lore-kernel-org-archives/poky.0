That's what I call 'hwcap'. OE currently lacks a decent way to build and =
install the permuations people want. For armv7a this boils down to =
NEON/VENUM or not, TI, Freescale and Qualcomm have it, Nvidia and =
Marvell don't.
This type of setup on ARM is only usefull for people who think that one =
rootfs to rule all boards is the best thing since sliced bread. It does =
make it really easy to hand people a rootfs and have it "just work" and =
not get caught in "why didn't you license NEON?" debates :)
