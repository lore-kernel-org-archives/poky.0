Yes thats probably better

usually if a patch has reviews that needs retouching it. It should go
back through the same cycle it went first time
which was my assumption here which obviously was not case here. the
patches to oe-core from yocto
I assumed were proposed through the branch to pull from and I think is
a good way to prune errors as patches move into
oe-core

Yes bisection is important. I guess I assumed too much even though I
was verifying
We need to have openembedded-core-contrib setup for people who do not
have possibility to use yocto-contrib
