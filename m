libm and libcrypt are added to LDLIBS unconditionally in Makefile.flags 
in busybox source code. I am trying to figure out why add them 
unconditionally. With these 2 options enabled and patch for busybox's 
defconf in attachment, I make the busybox compile succeed.

In the patch all the internet related features are disabled and some 
command such as awk, sed, grep(re support), mount( nfs feature), expr, 
logname, who, find, syslogd(remote log), rdate are removed or disabled .

busybox init could be used, and mdev is also used to replace udev.

tinylogin is removed.

Yes, perf runtime depends on elfutils,  python and perl, and perf also 
need elfutils to provide libelf for its compilation.

I remove the perl and python in linux-tools.inc file, but keep the 
elfutils. After that remove elfutils' dependency gettext, and add
EXTRA_OEMAKE = "-C libelf"
to build libelf only(because other subdirectories requires libc-ftraverse).

With sysvinit and tinylogin removed and busybox configured by patch in 
the attachment, and keep 3 eglibc options (libc-libm libc-crypt 
libc-posix-regexp), the size of image rootfs after extraction is *2.9M* 
for ppc. busybox is 432K after extraction and maybe remove 
libc-posix-regexp will decrease the size of it. I'll try to do that.

libc-posix-regexp is required by perf.

After get "libc-sunrpc libc-utmp libc-inet libc-nsswitch libc-getlogin" 
back, after add tinylogin and standard busybox, I get the size after 
extraction is *3.5M*.

I wonder how can I record my current work that other people can take 
advantage of it? For now I modify task-core-boot directly, but it seems  
unacceptable because other image also include task-core-boot. Should I 
add a new task-core-boot-minimal only include

     base-files \
     base-passwd \
     busybox \
     initscripts \
     modutils-initscripts

and take the configure informations and the steps into a document file?

Because we will begin yocto pam works next week, I hope I can finish the job in this week.

Thanks for your great help!

Kai
