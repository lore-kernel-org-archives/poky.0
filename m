Looks good. Some review comments:

* Is all of packagegroup-core-full-cmdline really needed for the master image 
or just some specific utilities that it pulls in?

* Could we have TEST_POWERCONTROL_EXTRA_ARGS so that TEST_POWERCONTROL_CMD can 
be set generically for the user's setup and extra machine-specific arguments 
(such as serial port numbers or other identifiers) can be set easily on a per-
machine basis if needed?

* I wonder if TEST_DEPLOY_CMDS should be lower-case since it would be most 
easily defined as a function i.e. testimage_deploy_cmds() { ... } than a 
traditional variable. (Reading it is exactly the same i.e. d.getVar().)

All of this seems generic enough that I think the better place for it would be 
OE-Core rather than meta-yocto-bsp. If you could apply these changes on top of 
OE-Core and send v3 to the OE-Core mailing list that would be great.

Thanks,
Paul
