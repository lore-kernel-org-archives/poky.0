FYI, in Arago I had to repackage util-linux-ng source tarball w/o lscpu pieces 
to completely avoid GPLv3, instead of removing them on the fly... In case when 
said source tarball needs to be mirrored or distributed with the build.

And, BTW, there is one more little script under GPLv3 - tests/ts/lscpu/lscpu
