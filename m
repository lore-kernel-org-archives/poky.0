RPM uses file 'colors' to handle the multilib conflict and installation pol=
icy.  The colors are defined as a bit field where so far only 3 bit are def=
ined.  Elf 32, elf 64, and MIPS n32.

So we have a way to do more then three, currently MIPS64 n32 is the only ar=
chitecture this is defined on.

I think definition may be an issue here.  When I speak of multilibs I am ta=
lking primarily about multiliple non-conflicting, ABI incompatible librarie=
s being installed at the same time.  This is the ELF 32 and ELF 64 case whe=
re the items can't be linked together, but can be installed and jrun on the=
 same machine.

The alternative is the case on ARM where we have one single ABI but multipl=
e ways to implement the code.. Thumb, neon, vfp, etc being options.  We wan=
t to do this as well, but while related, I see it as a diffent use case.

Multilib, install of binaries that will execute natively on the machine.

Lib dir names are already defined within the system configuration, but ther=
e hasn't been a lot of work to prove it's being used and is working properl=
y.  (everyone uses /lib today...)

Rpm really doesn't care or pay attention to the path, it's the elf file typ=
e that matters...
