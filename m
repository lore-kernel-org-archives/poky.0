I disagree here.  I think it would be MUCH better to have a 'SystemReady IR' 
hardware configuration.  So if SystemReady IR is desired, it is something that 
anyone can enable (starting with genericarm64).  Remember the defconfig is going 
to have more then hardware configs in it.  Will it have the right systemd 
configurations?  Will is have the magic filesystem a random user wants?  Will 
avoid having some other filesystem type that another user doesn't want?

Building up the kernel, and considering SystemReady IR as a 'hardware feature', 
and then add in the additional things that are needed for whatever reason is a 
much more reasonable way to do this and make it useful to otthers.

AMD does the same thing, for the kernel development it makes sense.  Kernel is 
built and tested standalone from userspace.

But with that said, I think it's the wrong way to do Yocto Project development. 
Yocto Project development needs further control and the separation of hardware 
and software configurations is pretty essential to having a system that can be 
customized appropriately.

The defconfig can be used as a guide to the other configurations, but separating 
hardware and software configs is a necessary first step in my opinion.
