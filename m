The first time the database is created on an RPM5 system it works
correctly.  However any subsequent rebuilds cause an empty database to
occur.

The following is from Michael Schroeder <mls@suse.de>:
> rpmdb2solv contains a hack that makes it use the unchanged already
> converted packages. To do this, it needs to get the database id
> for every installed packages by reading the "Name" index. This
> somehow doesn't seem to work with rpm5.
>
> As a workaround you can add a "ref = 0;" line at the top of the
> repo_add_rpmdb() function in ext/repo_rpmdb.c.
