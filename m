It fails with

$ bitbake core-image-sato-sdk -c testimage

RESULTS - systemd.SystemdBasicTests.test_systemd_failed: FAILED (0.56s)

It checks failed systemd services and got one:

UNIT              LOAD   ACTIVE SUB DESCRIPTION
● nfs-statd.service loaded failed failed NFS status monitor for NFSv2/3 
locking.


But when boot the qemu image or only run systemd testcases( with its 
dependenies), no such failure.
I doubt it may be affected by other test cases.

Kai
