I think it's important to keep in mind that the responsibilities for
redistribution/repackaging really are up to the end user (of OE-core) and their
lawyer's interpretation of the license.

As Richard mentioned, our goal is specifically to keep any code (that we know
of) that is GPLv3/LGPLv3 off of the target system via the exclude license
feature.  (Which can also be used to target other license types.)

Source distribution and such is still the responsibility of the (OE-core)
end-user and their lawyers to determine.  What we did might be good enough, and
might not..
