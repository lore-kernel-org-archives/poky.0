There are really two facets when people talk about multilibs.  The first is=
 what is discussed above, incompatible ABI that are compatible in regards o=
f running on the same hardware and can be collocated within a single filesy=
stem.   The other type of multilibs, common on ARM, is same ABI with differ=
ent optimizations, machine specific code.

Both types of multilibs need to be supported over time.

One of the complications though is deciding what packages to build for whic=
h multilibs.  We will need a way to say the default system libraries and co=
mponents should be say 32-bit.  But I need this one component to be 64-bit.=

I think the toolchain bootstrap is a place where the implementation of the =
toolchain can make this easier or MUCH harder.  In the environments I am us=
ed to using (code sorcery based toolchain) its a single binary that enables=
 the user to use many different multilibs.  However, this is likely not the=
 best/easiest approach for source based toolchain builds.  It's much easier=
 for use to just iteratively build toolchains for each multlib.  Using uniq=
ue filenames can make this fairly easy to implement with minimal changes to=
 the recipes.

Using something more complex like the CS toolchains, you can do simply by c=
reating specific wrappers that call the base common toolchain with the righ=
t parameters to switch the multlib settings..

Yes, when building multilibs there is a key set that has to exist before yo=
u can build anything else.  This normally includes libgcc, libstdcxx, and l=
ibc.  Otherwise general depenedencies can handle anything we need...  But a=
s mentioned before we need to understand which items to build and use for f=
ilesystem construction.

So when constructing a task or dependency list set we can do mysql, if we w=
ant the default or mysql-lib64 if we want the specific 64 bit version?  I t=
hink this is a place where we'll want to evaluate how people interact with =
the system and configuration files to find the best way to implement it.
