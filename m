Disabling PAT for qemu wouldn't be some horrible crime in the end; the
help text for the Kconfig option itself says:

     Say N here if you see bootup problems (boot crash, boot hang,
     spontaneous reboots) or a non-working video driver.

...and in theory PAT and the older MTRR are supposed to be performance
enhancements but not critical to have present.  I find it hard to get
excited about qemu video performance through the vesa driver.  :)
That said, it would be nice to fully understand what went pear shaped.

I know the feeling.  :)   Usually I find that being able to pinpoint the
exact commit where things failed adds that final bit of information
needed to get to the bottom of things.  Bruce and I fought with disks
disappearing on qemu versatile a while back and with a bisect traced it
down to some cryptic PCI swizzle mess.  But without the bisect pointing
us at where it went wrong, I'm not sure what we'd have done.  This case
is probably not that bad; it sounds like you've got 95% of it figured
out already.

Anyway to that end, I'm assuming here if we insert the 4.1 kernel
(presumably which also has PAT enabled) and leave X11 and qemu alone,
things work.  If so, we can use "debugpat" bootarg or debugfs to compare
the 4.1 and 4.4 PAT entries (as per Documentation/x86/pat.txt) to see
where things differ between the two kernels.

And/or we can look at some of the relevant changes between the two
versions (see below) and spot test reverts of any that look suspect.
Or, just jump to a brute force bisect, while keeping an eye on the
.config file along the way to ensure it remains consistent as we go.

If this is still unresolved Tues when I'm back in the office and
more easily able to test gfx issues, I'll look at doing bisection.
