The one thing that in my experience pushes most people in other
directiosn than OE is the complexity.  Unless OE made simpler, I think
it will be quite hard to reach the goal of significantly reducing the
number of build systems.

I am uncertain to what effect multilib in OE will have (positive and
negative), but it is clearly not making OE simpler.

I just kind of makes things a bit ehmm... hopeless that the requests I
(and others with similar customers) hear from companies are considered
out of line for OE evolution, whereas the requests you and others hear
can be used as valid arguments for which directions to take.

It is not that I think it will add considerable burden, but is just yet
another brick to the wall to pass for developers trying to understand
OE.

Anyways, you asked and I raised my concern.
