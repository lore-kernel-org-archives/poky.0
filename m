I have no problem with the idea of a genericarm64, but the defconfig
approach is not the way to go.

Yes, if you start with a giant "defconfig" file and try and slowly chip
away at it, it can be frustrating and time consuming.  I never do that.

It is the same problem space as trying to turn core-image-full-cmdline
into core-image-minimal by removing one package at a time.  Always
easier to start with the bare minimum and then add stuff.

In a word, the answer is "no".

Let me insert a bit of history here - darn near 20y ago now - when we
were just starting out with linux, we had BSPs on different kernel
versions, and worse - the use of flat monolithic "defconfig" type files
on a per BSP basis.  The latter was to be blunt, just crap.  There was
no uniformity across BSPs in the same "family" - where family would be
something like CGL back in the 2005 era.

One BSP might have built iso9660 fs, another one not. Or one enabled
some debug option and another one didn't.  The inconsistency was just
horrible and unbearable.  BSPs were screwing with options they had no
business touching.

After a couple years of that mess, I believe several of us (which
included Bruce and myself) had just about enough.  What we came up with
was isolating the board config to a select subset of hardware/driver
Kconfig options and the "platform" would handle "non-harware" options.

That largely is still what exists in Yocto today, even though we were
not using Yocto waaay back then.  It immediately brought consistency
across platforms, and a stark clarity to exactly what the board required
for Kconfig settings - typically less than a screen full - choose the
CPU and the driver for video and disk/flash and USB chip etc.  Compare
that to the unreadable 10,000+ lines in a defconfig now.

So, yes I'll grant you that making that one screen full of core hardware
settings can be frustrating.  But at the same time, it has also served
as a valuable filter.  If a person can't distill a BSP down into the
core options it *really* needs, then they typically either don't
understand the hardware, or are just not invested enough to go that
extra mile.  I'm not saying either is the case here - just in general.

On top of all that - we've had similar discussions before along similar
lines - where Yocto/OE are not RedHat or Ubuntu - where we try and
deliver a distro with "one config works everywhere" kind of stuff.

I'm fine with genericarm64 - but please please don't encourage the chaos
and madness associated with random unmaintainable defconfigs!  Just
because it exists upstream doesn't mean it is good.

Thanks,
Paul.
