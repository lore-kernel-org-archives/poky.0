I think that it's likely a good place to move it to soon after the filesystem has been mounted RW.  Do any of the scripts normally require networking or other system resources?

Hard to say what's perfect, but I certainly don't believe that they need
to be put off to the very last.   In any case, I think the best thing is
to make it easily adjustable, per my patch.

Can we please keep this discussion on the Poky list where it started?
It seems that OE (and maybe OE-core) handle this differently - I've not
looked in depth - and I'm mostly interested in getting my Poky builds
healthy.
