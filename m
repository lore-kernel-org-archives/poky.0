I have to admit I'm leaning towards pulling in the 4 recipes we need
since the win is we get to test the GL stacks.

We do support graphics in the core, we also do particularly badly at
testing it. That is something I think we need to change. piglit lets us
do that and its not like it has a significant number of dependencies.
Having a couple more python modules to test the python stack probably
isn't a bad idea ether. We pruned quite a number of recipes out, this is
a case where we can add a small number for a significant win.

I'm in favour of 1). If there is significant community push back against
that, I will go for 4) a kind of hybrid of 2/3 which is:

4) use combo-layer filtering technology to import just the files we want
from the meta-oe repo into the poky repo.

The plus of 4) is that it would showcase a usage of combo-layer which is
currently underused and IMO should be used more. Equally, I think 4)
might not be liked by some. If would however fulfil the needs the Yocto
Project has in this area.

I would still prefer 1) though.

Cheers,

Richard
