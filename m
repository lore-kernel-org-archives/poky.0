None of which really resembles the systems the typical OE developer is
working on.  My point being that what might be important goals for YP
might not be equally important for community OE as such.  Not that it
necesarely is a real conflict, but I believe it is worth keeping in
mind.

Cannot really be against improving software quality :-)
