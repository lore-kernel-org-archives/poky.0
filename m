All,

The following lays the groundwork for some rethinking of support for x86
platforms. In particular, the meta-intel layer will undergo some major
refactoring once this is merged. We believe it is of value to keep as much
of the tune files available in oe-core as possible, rather than isolating
them all in meta-intel.

This series renames the x86-related tune files, documents best practices,
updates the core2 tune file, adds a corei7 tune file, and updates the dependent
machine configs. This spans oe-core and poky and I feel it is best viewed as a
whole. Please forgive the cross-post.

The new corei7 tune file applies to Nehalem and Silvermont (Bay Trail) CPUs
which support up to SSE4.2. This provides an appropriate demarcation line while
maximizing compatibility as well as including optimal support for the current
generation of the embedded CPUs (Bay Trail) by including it in the new tune. AVX
(Sandy Bridge and beyond) is not included as that would not apply to Bay Trail,
although it can easily be added in a corei7-avx tune file as an additional
patch for users who care more about the last few percent of performance over
compatibility and consolidation.

An important note and likely a point of contention: The core2 update changes the
core2 arch to core2-32, making the 32 bit explicit rather than implied in order
to provide a consistent naming scheme going forward with newer tunes where
64 bit would be logical assumption if not explicitly stated. See patch 5/15 for
details on this bit.

Update the machines dependent on these tune files to use the new names.
As we remove x86_64, the 64b x86 machines now build as core2-64 for maximum
compatibility.

For reference, the corei7-64 tune defines:
    TARGET_CC_ARCH=" -m64 -march=corei7 -mtune=corei7 -mfpmath=sse -msse4.2"

While the corei2-32 tune defines:
    TARGET_CC_ARCH=" -m32 -march=core2 -mtune=core2 -msse3 -mfpmath=sse"

v2:
o Replace Intel with X86 in the x86-base.inc per Martin Jansa's review
o Update the yocto-bsp substrate templates for core2 and corei7 tunes
o Update the profile-manual documentation for core2-32 terminology
o Add eglibc-ld.inc patch.... this one needs review
