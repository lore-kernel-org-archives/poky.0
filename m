In the absence of definitely proof that we are missing something, I'm
ok with suggesting that we have a single -dev package.

Is there a 3rd option of a virtual package called linux-kernel-headers
that maps to -dev ? I have no idea if that is even possible or desirable,
but I thought I'd mention it.

I like #1, since we really are talking about development vs just some
headers lying around :)
