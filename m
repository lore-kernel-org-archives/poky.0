Does it harvest all known machines from the configured layers? Assuming
so, but thought I'd check as it hadn't come up in our previous discussions.

It seems to me this might be less surprising if the tools was presented
as an image "configurator" as opposed to an image builder. I'm not
arguing for a name change here, but something to consider about how the
tool is perceived. The assisted configuration is where this tool is the
most valuable in my opinion, the building part is mostly just eye candy.

Is "Exclude GPLv3 packages" the only license related option of significance?

In my workflow, the build area is also a key part of my "workspace". I
keep one for each permutation of
(bernard|master)*(n450|beagleboard|qemux86|...). I find I run into fewer
issues this way. I share downloads and may eventually share sstate as I
learn how to work with it and not just periodically delete it ;-)

The point being that if the concept of "Workspace" also included the
build directory, then the changes to local.conf and bblayers.conf
wouldn't be any surprise to the user at all. Having a configurable build
directory is pretty important for performance reasons as well where you
may have a RAID0 array for your build partition and don't want to use
./build.

It's certainly usable as is, but it could reach a broader audience if
the concept of workspace were to include the build dir.

I really like this bit. It just occurred to me though that it would be
nice to be able to adjust the priority of these layers, and then resort
the rows accordingly. Unfortunatley, that really involves changing the
layer config file, which should probably be off limits to this tool for
layers it isn't creating... maybe... hrm. Something to consider anyway.

Really coming along and looking great.
