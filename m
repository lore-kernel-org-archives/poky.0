It could still be something that the kernel can work around, Toshi
did say:

There is a matter of how qemu emulates CPU features.  There is no such
Intel CPU that supports PAT w/o MTRR.  This is why the current code
assumes this dependency.

Which is likely the trigger, we've send information about the cpu to
him, and with that there's a chance for a pat fix.

He repeated our thought of running with 'nopat' while a fix is
considered.

It may be some time before that happens, and I was going to test
with the kernel patch dropped, and nopat in the qemu boot args. If
that works, I'd rather run with that, and then revisit when (if)
there's more changes upstream.
