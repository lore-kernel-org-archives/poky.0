That's not fair.  While I do "rip out" (to use your choice of colorful
term) stuff in OE-lite, I do and did not proppose to rip out any
features from OE.  I did comment that sstate as a pice of code might not
be give as much value if some of the concepts from OE-lite were
implemented.

Sorry, but I must take offence on that remark.  I do not feel that your
approach is anymore reasoned than mine.  It is different, and you
clearly prefer your approach, I don't question that.

Yes, that is measuring Yocto "user" usability.

I am at least as much concerned with long-time developer usability.
Given the amount of long-time developers normally available in OE, I
find it disappointing that at any time, almost noone (at most a very
small handful) dares to comment on RFC's touch core parts, such as
BitBake and gcc/glibc recipes.  I am firmly convinced that "we" (whoever
that might be) can do better than that.  I also believe that this is one
of the biggest reasons that there are so many embedded Linux
buildsystems.  Most people agrees that OE is among (if not the) most
advanced embedded Linux build system, but many of them end up using some
of the simpler tools.  With careful design, and constant refactoring, I
believe that you can lead in both features and simplicity, but you have
to accept that code and design concepts will be discarded when something
better turns up.
