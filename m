Uhm... am I the only one for whom this language is really confusing?
"merged out" ?
"restore the checkpoint" ?
Why does a BSP using a different meta SRCREV get two meta branches?

The fix of incrementing the allowed count of meta branches honestly
feels like a bandaid. Why do we create two in the first place?

Regardless, this is a blocker for working with meta-intel, so we need
this in. But it does seem to me that a more direct solution may be
needed. Bruce, can you help fill me in re. the above?
