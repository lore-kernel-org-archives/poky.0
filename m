I continue to have mixed feelings about this: 

* We've not done side by side build comparisons with something like
buildhistory.

* Figuring out any runtime issues with dlopen is the hardest part and we
don't actually have real data on whether there are issues there or not.

* We'd be deviating from the way the libtool authors suggest their tool
should operate. This makes filing bug reports and interacting with
upstream harder. I continue to dream of a libtool with working sysroot
support for example instead of carrying our hacks/workarounds/bugfixes.

* They are used in places, for example the darwin shlibs code currently
uses them. It could be updated to use otool these days mind but I'd
probably make the current code a fallback for unknown arches since it is
guaranteed to work everywhere.

So whilst I know several people love to just delete them, its a slightly
more complex issue than that.

Cheers,

Richard (who isn't keen on libtool and would rather replace that instead)
