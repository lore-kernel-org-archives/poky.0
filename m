I'm not familiar with this code either, but I'll start doing some bisects
to see if
we can isolate the commit that introduced the behaviour change. This is the
sort of thing that is very rare, and really isn't supposed to happen. So
until
I read the commit log where the change was triggered, I'd lean to it being
a bug
and something to report and fix upstream.

I know that I booted sato with the 4.4 update, do we have any other
confirmations
that this worked, or was I the only one doing 4.4 boot tests until I sent
the
patch to bump the preferred version ?

I would. I'd rather not paper over this by changing the config fragments,
since
once we throw that switch, it'll most likely sit there .. covered up.

x86/PAT: Xorg:705 map pfn expected mapping type uncached-minus for [mem 0xf=
d000000-0xfdffffff], got write-combining<br>
<br>
</div></div>The entry in question is setup by uvesafb which in its<br>
uvesafb_ioremap() function calls ioremap_wc().<br>
<br>
It appears that Xorg mmaps this from userspace, then later does a<br>
fork() to execute a utility. At this point, when creating the vmas for<br>
the new process, the pat code says &quot;eeek!&quot; as the protection mode=
 for<br>
the new vmas don&#39;t match the old one, returns -EINVAL, the process dies=
<br>
and X goes with it.<br>
<br>
There are a few hammers we can hit this with, we can boot with &quot;nopat&=
quot;<br>
option which makes the problem go away, or turn off CONFIG_X86_PAT. No<br>
surprises there. Changing uvesafb to use mtrr=3D0 doesn&#39;t help since th=
e<br>
ioremap_wc call still happens.<br>
<br>
The real issue is the &quot;expected mapping type uncached-minus for got<br=
>
write-combining&quot; message, it all goes wrong from there.<br>
<br>
Upon looking at the code and scratching my head for a long while, I<br>
notice that there are two ways of representing the protection mode<br>
data, &quot;enum page_cache_mode&quot; and &quot;pgprot_t &amp; _PAGE_CACHE=
_MASK&quot;.<br>
<br>
The exact meaning of pgprot_t depends on which CPU you&#39;re running,<br>
older CPUs have errata meaning only a small number of bits can be used.<br>
The exact mapping table is determined by __cachemode2pte_tbl and is<br>
updated at boot by calls from update_cache_mode_entry().<br>
<br>
The result of this if you map enum -&gt; pgprot_t, then try to do pgprot_t<=
br>
-&gt; enum, you can get different values since its not a 1:1 mapping.<br>
<br>
This means the comparison in reserve_pfn_range() where it does &quot;pcm !=
=3D<br>
want_pcm&quot; isn&#39;t correct and can trigger even in cases where there =
isn&#39;t<br>
a problem.<br>
<br>
This can be &quot;fixed&quot; by doing cachemode2protval(pcm) !=3D<br>
cachemode2protval(want_pcm) and checking whether the protection bits<br>
match, rather than the enum values, since in reality this is what we<br>
really care about.<br>
<br>
I can confirm that if I make that change, X boots up just fine.<br>
<br>
The problem is I really have no idea what I&#39;m doing :).<br>
<br>
Could someone who understands this code have a look and see whether the<br>
