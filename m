I had originally written the IP matching stuff in C, but converted to
shell to
keep this script self contained and easily deployable. The proper way to
do this
with python would require the use of external modules, which may or may
not be
installed on the target system. Although I suppose even just replacing this
script and all the math it does in python might be an improvement.
However, For
the purposes of a one-stop-shop example git proxy script for oe-core, I
think
bash still serves us best here. Otherwise, yes, I completely agree it's
horrible
to look at :-)
