The -dev package argument is a good one, we seem to be surviving without
those and that probably addresses the concern I was thinking of. I'm
also thinking of ltdl and its dlopen wrapping, not dlopen itself which
is a much smaller subset of recipes.

It does seem somewhat tricky, agreed.

There are ways to avoid problems for darwin. Using otool instead of
the .la files would be nice, equally mangling DISTRO_FEATURES based on
an SDK override is possible, albeit ugly. The la handling code will
likely bitrot as soon as its disabled by default and metadata starts
getting dropped which is probably a bigger concern. The number of SDK
darwin builds is currently a tiny portion of the usercase and codebase.

I guess the .la files just don't seem to be a big issue that some people
seem to paint them as. Why do we need to remove them and deviate from
the upstream?

Anyhow, if someone can show some world builds with and without the .la
files and see what build history shows we'd be closer to taking a patch
to turning them off. If we do it, we'll have to do it everywhere for
everything since the remaining code will bitrot badly IMO otherwise.

Cheers,

Richard
