I missed a couple things I'm getting to now:

* the yocto-bsp substrates
* the inclusion of XSERVER_IA32_* in the genericx86 BSPs
* the eglibc-ld.inc file .... I need some help here, but am 
  updating the core2 references and adding corei7... do we 
  really have to do this for every tune file!?!?
* profile-manual core2 references

Coming in v2
