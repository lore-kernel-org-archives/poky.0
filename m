There are a few related patches to this floating around and I know Tom
did some work in OE.dev to make perl-native an early bootstrap
dependency.

I've been giving this some thought and given the various goals we have,
I think the long term best solution is going to be to place perl into an
isolated bin directory in sysroots, then for anything using really using
perl-native, add that directory to PATH. This is similar to what we now
do with the bootstrap toolchains in OE-Core. This way the dependencies
are deterministic and either perl is or isn't required but we don't
instantly need to build perl-native or run the risk of nasty loops in
the early bootstrap. Anything requiring perl-native would add the
directory to PATH, probably using a tiny class file.

The above patches still would make sense of course.

Cheers,

Richard
