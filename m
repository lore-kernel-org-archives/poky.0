From an RPM perspective the real difference is that one type uses multiple =
recipe builds and let's install time policy decide what to install.. (this =
is the multilib mentioned above)

The ARM case I mentioned is really optimization based.. There are a few key=
 components like gcc that need to be configured for the multiple types of s=
ystems, but the decision on what to install (a.k.a. What special optimizati=
ons are required) are made at recipe compile time.

This is why they're related cases, we need a common way to specify these mu=
ltiple library type optimization and configuration flags... But the eventua=
l result install-time vs compile-time is what makes them different.

> The other issue on ARM embedded systems is that the processor feature app=
roach typically makes the system larger, by providing both the lesser optim=
ized and more completely optimized libraries....  I've had resistence to th=
is approach from customer over that reason.  (mind you I'm in favor of maki=
ng that easier to use in OE as well.)
