Directdisk images are images that can be directly dd'ed to a raw 
harddrive and booted from.  They are different from "live" image which 
can be booted from usbstick.

currently the -directdisk images are broken in that they use a fixed 
partition table in a file and you end up with bad partition sizes.

To remove them, we just delete some recipes and infrastructre for them, 
look for anything ending with -directdisk in the reciple or class name.
