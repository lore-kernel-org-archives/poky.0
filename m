I was considering this last night as well.

And I landed here as well.

Should we attempt this approach and only break them apart if somebody
screams?

Would you prefer this even if we merge it with the existing kernel-dev?
I think my order of preference would be:

1) Merge with kernel-dev and leave the name as kernel-dev for
   consistency

2) New package called linux-kernel-headers
