Yes, I have a working solution, but have been trying to polish it up and 
getting pulled away on other bugs. I'll clean it up and push it out by 
tonight, although I expect a few review cycles will be needed before we 
are all happy with it.

The tricky part is balancing the complexity of building the configured 
source tree with the size it takes up in sysroots. It can be done in as 
little as 80MB, but the easiest way (and the easiest to maintain going 
forward) is 500MB. More on that tonight.
