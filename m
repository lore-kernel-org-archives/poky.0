Dear Paul Eggleton,

In message <41ae31ba057b63d3c518e2edf217109c59b64603.1301578942.git.paul.eggleton@linux.intel.com> you wrote:

The instructions you delete appear to be pretty generic ones, and I
see no reason why they would not work.

If the Poky too chain has issues with this, then there is a problem
with that tool chain, and you should enter a bug report.

What exactly would that problem be?

In any case, just papering over the problems seems not a good
startegy to me.

Best regards,

Wolfgang Denk
