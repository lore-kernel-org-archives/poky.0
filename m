I missed that the kernel module was missing. Oops. That's easy enough to
add to the common-pc graphics fragment. But what we need to know is if
we should try to get MGA into oe-core or not. I honestly don't
understand why we shouldn't, with intel and omap in there already. It
seems silly to have a special layer for the xorg driver when mesa and
the kernel already build their part for the same hardware....

Are there any compelling arguments for not including the mga driver in
oe-core?
