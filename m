There are two modes here. One is where you are adding your own changes,
in this case it makes sense to harvest CC's from the patches. The other
is when you are pulling in patches from other sources where the authors
don't want to be receiving email. In the latter case, the user must be
responsible to not use the -a option (auto cc). This is a fairly unique
situation, you have to be pulling from a parallel environment. Kernel to
kernel, layer to layer. But if I am adding a patch to a recipe, the CC's
in that patch shouldn't get picked up because they will be part of the
diff (prefaced with "+ ") and not in the commit message.

Am I missing a use case?
